#### Theoretical Foundation
Projectile motion follows a parabolic trajectory under uniform gravitational acceleration.  
The horizontal range of a projectile launched at an angle $$ \theta $$ with initial velocity $$ v_0 $$ is given by:  

$$ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} $$  

The range depends on $$ \theta $$, $$ v_0 $$, and $$ g $$, with a maximum at $$ \theta = 45^\circ $$.

#### Analysis of the Range
- The range increases with $$ \theta $$ up to $$ 45^\circ $$, then decreases symmetrically.  
- Higher $$ v_0 $$ increases the range, while greater $$ g $$ decreases it.  

#### Practical Applications
- **Sports**: Optimal angles for throwing and shooting.  
- **Engineering**: Ballistics and projectile launch optimization.  

#### Implementation
Use Python to simulate projectile motion and visualize the range vs. angle relationship.
